2.Designer (with default values)
3.Destructor
4.Method that returns a tape representation of a class (__str __ ())
5.Static field
6.Static method that returns the value of a static field
7.In the main () method, identify 3 objects of type from the task (due to the transfer of different number of parameters) and display information about them using the method from step 4 in the console
8.The developed code should be flooded into the hit repository as a pull request! The repository should have a README and .gitignore file.
